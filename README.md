# 42_ft_containers
Reimplement C++ containers!
[02/2021-03/2021]

- List
- Vector
- Map
- Stack
- Queue

Use https://www.cplusplus.com/ as reference. Follow class implementation as closely as possible, without using the STL.

- implement tests
- implement iterators when necessary
- disregard get_allocator()

To check leaks :
- in macOS, uncomment the "leaks" line at the bottom of main.cpp.
- in linux, use Valgrind

/!\ Depending on your OS, max_size() results may vary. My results were checked for Ubuntu18 and macOS.
