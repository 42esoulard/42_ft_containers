Reimplement C++ containers!
[02/2021-03/2021]

Reimplement C++ containers :
• List
• Vector
• Map
• Stack
• Queue


Use https://www.cplusplus.com/ as reference. Follow class implementation as closely as possible, without using the STL.

-> implement tests
-> implement iterators when necessary
-> disregard get_allocator()


To check leaks :
- in macOS, uncomment the "leaks" line at the bottom of main.cpp.
- in linux, use Valgrind
