• Implement the following containers, and turn in the necessary files <container>.hpp
• You must also provide a main.cpp which tests everything for your evaluations.
• Ignore the Alloc template and associated functions. Non-member overloads are expected.
• If the container has an iterator system, you must reimplement it, with your own system of traits to differenciate them. It has to behave like 
 the std iterators but can be implemented in your own way. (Hint : SFINAE ...)
• Reverse Iterators must be a template class.
• You can use https://www.cplusplus.com/ as a reference of what to implement.
• You cannot implement more public functions than the ones offered in the standard
containers. Everything else must be private or protected. Each public function/-
variable must be justified.
• For non-member overloads, the keyword friend is allowed. Each use of friend
must be justified and will be checked during evaluation.
You must turn in the following containers and their associated functions:
• List 
• Vector
• Map
• Stack
• Queue

The underlying mechanism (arrays, doubly chained circular list, BST, vector<vector <> >, ... ) of each container of the stl must be reproduced thoroughly.

Of course, STL is forbidden. You are however allowed to use the STD library.

BONUS

• Deque +2%
• Set +2%
• Multiset +2%
• Multimap +2%
• Vector<bool> specialization +2%
• An iterator system that derives from the std::iterators_traits that can be 
    used with both the ft::containers and the std::containers alike () +5%
